# UGVR-Game-Config-Files
 Repository to share UGVR game config files for Godot 4 games

This site will host my preferred game config files for Godot 4 3D games converted to VR with the UGVR mod.

PRs are welcome to add games or options (e.g., "left handed mode", "swap controllers mode")

To use the files, unzip into your game directory so there is just a single XRConfigs directory in your game directory that has the three config files in it for that game.

UGVR will detect the files automatically.

Learn how to modify the game files on the UVGR wiki found here: https://github.com/teddybear082/UGVR/wiki (once I actually create that section!).
